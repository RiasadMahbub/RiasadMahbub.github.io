## Senior Graduate Research Assistant
#### Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, University of Arkansas
##### Fayetteville, AR
##### January 2021 to May 2026

- Conducted research on satellite image analysis of rice photosynthesis to improve understanding of crop productivity.
- Worked on research projects and publications related to:
  - Remote Sensing
  - Carbon Flux Measurement
  - Geospatial Analysis
- Developed GPP (gross primary productivity) maps and performed gap-filling and partitioning of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) data to analyze carbon uptake and release at the landscape scale.
- Collected and processed field data:
  - Calibrated LI-7500 and LI-7700 sensors to ensure accurate measurements.
  - Compiled and standardized field measurements for AmeriFlux, supporting large-scale carbon and climate research.
  - Assisted with installation and maintenance of Campbell Scientific datalogger sensors.
- Conducted field experiments measuring methane emissions from fish in rice fields, contributing to ecosystem-level greenhouse gas studies.
- Funding:  
  - NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) Grant 80NSSC21K1002
  - U.S. Geological Survey Agreement G20AC00448  
  - NSF CBET CAREER Award #1752083
