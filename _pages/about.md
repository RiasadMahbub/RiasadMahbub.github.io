My research focuses on modeling methane emissions and photosynthetic activity in Arkansas rice systems to improve landscape-scale predictions of carbon and greenhouse gas dynamics. I develop high-resolution maps of growing-season length and carbon uptake, evaluate methods for estimating crop phenology, and refine eddy covariance data through post-processing and instrument calibration. My work combines environmental modeling, remote sensing, GIS, data science, rice agriculture, forest land-use change, and social-ecological systems to better understand complex agricultural landscapes. This cross-disciplinary background allows me to develop holistic solutions, connect insights across teams, and translate scientific understanding into actionable strategies. I’m particularly interested in applying these skills—satellite analytics, geospatial modeling, and quantitative problem-solving—to support sustainable agriculture, carbon management, and data-driven environmental decision-making.

## Professional Goals
I aim to use data-driven analysis to advance sustainability, climate solutions, and responsible land management. Through working across multiple sites, spatial scales, and temporal scales spanning 30 mintues to 400 years, I have developed the ability to approach environmental problems from a multifaceted perspective. I enjoy work that involves coding, modeling, and designing practical tools to evaluate environmental impacts, and I am especially passionate about geospatial and satellite-based analysis using vegetation indices, land-cover data, and crop information to quantify how agriculture and industry influence carbon, methane, and broader ecosystem processes. This experience enables me to connect field-level observations to broader environmental patterns, design holistic solutions, and translate complex data into actionable insights. I am seeking roles in agricultural sustainability, carbon accounting, environmental monitoring, and geospatial analytics where I can link local practices to landscape- and regional-scale outcomes. With my background in environmental research and data science, I am well-prepared to support work in ecological footprint analysis, life-cycle assessment, ESG impact evaluation, and translating climate and carbon data into actionable strategies for policy and sustainable development.
