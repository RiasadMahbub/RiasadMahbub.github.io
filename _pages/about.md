Riasad’s current research focuses on improving the understanding the landscape prediction of methane emissions and photosynthesis in rice crops across Arkansas. He creates detailed maps showing how long the growing season lasts and how much carbon rice plants take in. His work also looks at which methods and measurements work best for estimating crop growth and season length at specific sites. Additionally, Riasad is engaged in post-processing of eddy covariance data and the calibration of related instruments. He is particularly interested in applying his skills in data-centric analysis and environmental remote sensing to global agricultural development projects. He is especially interested in applying his skills in data analysis, satellite technology, and systems thinking to advance sustainable agriculture, carbon management, and environmental solutions, aligning with his broader interests in sustainability, GIS, and data-driven policy.

## Professional Goals
I strive to contribute to a more sustainable future for our planet through data-driven research and analysis. Studying environmental science has deepened my understanding of the global challenges we face and equipped me with tools to address them. I enjoy work that involves coding, developing algorithms, and exploring innovative solutions. I’m particularly passionate about applying mapping and geospatial analysis (using satellite indices, land cover data, and crop information) to assess agriculture’s environmental impact. I am currently seeking opportunities in fields such as agricultural sustainability, carbon accounting, and environmental monitoring, where I can help link farming practices to planetary boundary pressures and advance data-informed land management strategies. With my experience in data analysis and environmental research, I am eager to apply my skills to sustainability-focused roles that quantify ecological footprints, perform life cycle assessments, and evaluate the environmental and social impacts of different products.
