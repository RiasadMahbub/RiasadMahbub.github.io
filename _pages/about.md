Riasad's current research centers on improving the understanding of methane and GPP prediction of rice crops in Arkansas, particularly on developing spatial dataset of growing season length, GPP, and ideal site-specific adaptable parameters on prediction. His research explores the role of different vegetation indices to predict GPP, and growing season length in Arkansas. Riasad also works on analyzing post processing Eddy covariance data and calibration of the instruments. In future, he is particularly interested in applying his expertise in data-centric analysis and environmental remote sensing to agricultural development initiatives led by organizations such as the FAO, World Bank, and WWF, with a focus on Mediterranean and tropical agroecosystems.

## Professional Goals
I strive to add value through data-driven research efforts. I thrive when facing challenging objectives with ample learning opportunities, and in environments that fosters collaboration and celebrates diversity of ideas. I enjoy work that allows me to code the day away, develop algorithms, and explore innovative ideas. I am passionate about adapting information science concepts in an existing domain to different fields, innovating in perspectives.
