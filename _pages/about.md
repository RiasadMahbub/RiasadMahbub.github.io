Riasad’s current research focuses on improving the understanding the landscape prediction of methane emissions and photosynthesis in rice crops across Arkansas. He creates detailed maps showing how long the growing season lasts and how much carbon rice plants take in. His work also looks at which methods and measurements work best for estimating crop growth and season length at specific sites. Additionally, Riasad is engaged in post-processing of eddy covariance data and the calibration of related instruments. He is particularly interested in applying his skills in data-centric analysis and environmental remote sensing to global agricultural development projects. He is especially interested in applying his skills in data analysis, satellite technology, and systems thinking to advance sustainable agriculture, carbon management, and environmental solutions, aligning with his broader interests in sustainability, GIS, and data-driven policy.

## Professional Goals
I strive to contribute to a more sustainable future through data-driven research and analysis. Studying environmental science has deepened my understanding of global challenges and equipped me with the tools to address them. I enjoy work that involves coding, problem-solving, and developing innovative solutions, and I am particularly passionate about applying mapping and geospatial analysis—using satellite indices, land cover data, and crop information—to evaluate the environmental impacts of agriculture and industry. I am seeking opportunities in agricultural sustainability, carbon accounting, and environmental monitoring, where I can connect farming practices to planetary boundary pressures and advance data-informed land management strategies. With my experience in data analysis and environmental research, I am eager to apply my skills to a variety of sustainability-focused roles, including quantifying ecological footprints, performing life cycle assessments, evaluating environmental and social impacts of products, and translating climate science into actionable solutions for policy and sustainable development.
