Riasad’s current research focuses on improving the understanding and prediction of methane emissions and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) in rice crops across Arkansas. His work involves developing spatial datasets of growing season length, GPP, and identifying site-specific adaptable parameters to enhance prediction accuracy. He investigates the effectiveness of various vegetation indices in estimating both GPP and the duration of the growing season. Additionally, Riasad is engaged in post-processing of eddy covariance data and the calibration of related instruments. Looking ahead, he is particularly interested in applying his skills in data-centric analysis and environmental remote sensing to agricultural development projects led by global organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Bank, and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).

## Professional Goals
I strive to contribute to a more sustainable future for our planet through data-driven research and analysis. Studying environmental science has deepened my understanding of the global challenges we face and equipped me with tools to address them. I enjoy work that involves coding, developing algorithms, and exploring innovative solutions. I’m particularly passionate about applying mapping and geospatial analysis—using satellite indices, land cover data, and crop information—to assess agriculture’s environmental impact. I am currently seeking opportunities in fields such as agricultural sustainability, carbon accounting, and environmental monitoring, where I can help link farming practices to planetary boundary pressures and advance data-informed land management strategies.
