I am a PhD candidate at the University of Arkansas and finishing my degree on May 2026. My research focuses on modeling methane emissions and photosynthetic activity in Arkansas rice systems to improve landscape-scale predictions of carbon and greenhouse gas dynamics. I develop high-resolution maps of growing-season length and carbon uptake, evaluate methods for estimating crop phenology, and refine eddy covariance data through post-processing and instrument calibration. My work combines environmental modeling, remote sensing, GIS, data science, rice agriculture, forest land-use change, and social-ecological systems to better understand complex agricultural landscapes. This cross-disciplinary background allows me to develop holistic solutions, connect insights across teams, and translate scientific understanding into policies. I’m particularly interested in applying these skills in geospatial modeling and quantitative problem-solving to support sustainable agriculture, carbon management, and data-driven environmental decision-making.

## Professional Goals
I use data-driven analysis to advance sustainability, climate solutions, and land management. My work spans multiple sites and scales, from 30-minute flux measurements to 400-year land-use records, giving me an integrative perspective that links field-level observations to broader environmental patterns. I specialize in coding, modeling, and geospatial analysis, particularly satellite-based vegetation indices, land-cover data, and crop information to assess agricultural and industrial impacts on carbon, methane, and ecosystem processes. I am seeking roles in agricultural sustainability, carbon accounting, environmental monitoring, and geospatial analytics, where I can translate climate and carbon data into actionable strategies for policy, ESG evaluation, and sustainable development.
