I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Arkansas (May 2026), where I studied methane emissions and photosynthesis in Arkansas rice systems. I focus on mapping crop growth, processing eddy covariance data, and using remote sensing, GIS, and data science to understand agricultural and forested landscapes. My work connects field data, satellite observations, and environmental systems to support sustainable agriculture and forested ecosystems.

## Professional Goals
I aim to apply quantitative and geospatial analysis to support environmental decision-making, sustainability, and climate solutions. My expertise spans satellite vegetation indices, land-cover data, carbon and methane flux modeling, and ecological modeling. I am seeking opportunities in agricultural sustainability, carbon accounting, environmental monitoring, and geospatial analytics.
