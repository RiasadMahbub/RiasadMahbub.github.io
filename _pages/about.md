My research focuses on modeling methane emissions and photosynthetic activity in Arkansas rice systems to improve landscape-scale predictions of carbon and greenhouse gas dynamics. I develop high-resolution maps of growing-season length and carbon uptake, evaluate methods for estimating crop phenology, and refine eddy covariance data through post-processing and instrument calibration. My work combines environmental modeling, remote sensing, and data science to better understand agricultural systems. I’m particularly interested in applying these skills—satellite analytics, geospatial modeling, and quantitative problem-solving—to support sustainable agriculture, carbon management, and data-driven environmental decision-making.

## Professional Goals
I aim to use data-driven analysis to advance sustainability, climate solutions, and responsible land management. I enjoy work that involves coding, modeling, and designing practical tools to evaluate environmental impacts. I am especially passionate about geospatial and satellite-based analysis using vegetation indices, land-cover data, and crop information to quantify how agriculture and industry influence carbon, methane, and broader ecosystem processes. I am seeking roles in agricultural sustainability, carbon accounting, environmental monitoring, and geospatial analytics where I can connect field practices to large-scale environmental outcomes. With my background in environmental research and data science, I am well-prepared to support work in ecological footprint, life-cycle assessment, ESG impact evaluation, and translating climate and carbon data into actionable insights for policy and sustainable development.
