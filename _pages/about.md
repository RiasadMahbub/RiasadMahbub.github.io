I am a Ph.D. graduate from the University of Arkansas (May 2026). My research focused on modeling methane emissions and photosynthetic activity in Arkansas rice systems to improve landscape-scale predictions of carbon and greenhouse gas dynamics. I specialize in high-resolution mapping of crop phenology, eddy covariance data processing, and environmental modeling, integrating remote sensing, GIS, and data science to understand agricultural and forested landscapes. My work bridges field data, satellite observations, and socio-ecological systems to inform sustainable agriculture and carbon management.

## Professional Goals
I aim to apply quantitative and geospatial analysis to support environmental decision-making, sustainability, and climate solutions. My expertise spans satellite vegetation indices, land-cover data, carbon and methane flux modeling, and ecological modeling. I am seeking opportunities in agricultural sustainability, carbon accounting, environmental monitoring, and geospatial analytics.
