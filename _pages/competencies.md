#### Google Earth Engine Workflow  
**Mapping Crop Rotation and Monoculture Patterns**

This Google Earth Engine script identifies and visualizes crop rotation patterns using the USDA Cropland Data Layer (CDL) from 2008â€“2020. It employs the **agkit4ee** module to detect monoculture and rotation sequences (e.g., riceâ€“soybean, cornâ€“soybean) for major crops such as rice, corn, soybean, cotton, and wheat. The resulting output provides color-coded map layers showing where each cropping pattern occurs across the agricultural landscape.

**Modeling 2020 Crop Frequency and Intensity Across Arkansas**  

This Google Earth Engine script models and visualizes the 2020 spatial distribution and frequency of major crops across Arkansas using multi-year data (2008â€“2020) from the USDA Cropland Data Layer (CDL). Using the **agkit4ee** module, it estimates occurrence frequencies for corn, cotton, rice, soybean, wheat, and double-cropped wheatâ€“soybean systems.  

The workflow produces color-coded frequency maps, generates histograms of rice distribution, and exports each cropâ€™s 2020 intensity layer to Google Drive as GeoTIFFs. These outputs help assess spatial cropping intensity and dominant crop patterns across the state.
